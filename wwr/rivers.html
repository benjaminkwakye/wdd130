            <h2>Rivers</h2>
            <p>This page is to give information about the rivers that the company runs. </p>
            <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>
            <p2>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in 
                love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                sheep are also commonly sighted.
                The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over
                the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                undammed rivers in the United States. 
                As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower,
                slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...
                but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
                water more.</p2>
            <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
            <p3>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to
                Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p3>
            <h4> frequently Asked Questions FAQ</h4>
            <p>This is a place to answer frequently asked client questions.</p>

            <p>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow? </p>
            <p2>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of
                8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). 
                A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time.
                Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the
                most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids 
                which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river 
                guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p2>
            <p>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</p>
            <p2>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p2>
            <p>What is included in the trip?</p>
            <p2>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.
                We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</p2>
            <p>What do I need to bring?</p>
            <p2>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap. Sunglasses with strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before camper wear: Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. water bottle small day pack for hikes moisturizing lotion headlamp or flashlight moleskin waterproof sunscreen and lip balm optional items: gloves fleece jacket towel bandana small pillow hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo camera equipment book, watercolors, journal and pen</p2>
